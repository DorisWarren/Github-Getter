## Description
_GG (Github-Getter) Is a single page application written in React that will allow users to search through Github repositories via key word. It will populate and sort your result based on the highest amount of star_count._
*_React (version: "^16.13.0")_

## Development Notes
* _I challenged my self and decided to use React hooks on this project. I did this because, hooks are my not my strong suit. But hey...I feel much better about it now!_
* _working through the code I would change the structure of how I displayed the data. I would have the ul tags and replace them with a div to make my code cleaner and readable. It made it quite painful to style._
* _If I where to have more time, I would add animations to my search bar to make it feel alive. I would also add boxes/box-shadows around each repo. Doing this would make selecting the repo easier instead of having to hover over the repositories name and then click._
* _Another biggie would be limiting the amount of data to ten repositories at a time._
* _I would love to chat a bit more with you about future changes to this application. Cheers!_
